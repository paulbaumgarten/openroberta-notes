# Open Roberta tutorials & notes

> Note: These repo is an unmaintained archive.

The following is a series of tutorials and challenges for you to complete with your mission partner. They are intended to teach you the core skills required to be able to successfully complete the mission.

## Looking after the lego

* Lost pieces must be accounted for! 
  * I keep records of who is assigned each kit. 
  * Every kit will be checked for missing parts at the end of the unit.
* Never throw Lego (or you might find yourself doing paper & pen work instead)
* When we are working with the Lego, the last 5 minutes is dedicated to pack-up. Do not keep working once I give the pack-up warning.
* No one leaves a Lego lesson until:
  * There is no Lego on floor, tables, or otherwise out of a kit!
  * All kits are properly packed, lids attached, and neatly stacked.

## Build a basic robot

Using the printed manuals, follow the instructions from page 1 through 46. A digital copy of the [assembly instructions](lego-assembly-instructions.pdf) is also available.

Do not start adding your own elements to the robot at this time, just stick to the base model. You will change your robot design later.

## Create your first program

Watch the first tutorial video to learn how to use the Open Roberta software and create your first program.

## Level 1 challenges

You are now ready to experiment and attempt the level 1 challenges. No sensors are required at this stage, and no extra lego
additions to the robot.

Do experiment with different blocks to see how they behave, such as the ones shown on this page.

Complete at least two level 1 challenges. Demonstrate them to the teacher for signature when ready.

* Challenge 1A: Go forward exactly 1 meter, wait for 3 seconds, reverse, stop at starting original point.
* Challenge 1B: Go in a perfect square (sharp turn on the corners)
* Challenge 1C: Go in a perfect circle (diameter at least 50cm), stopping and starting at the same point.

## Complete videos 2, 3 & 4
 
 Watch these videos and follow along replicating the functionality with your own EV3.

* [Video 4: Colour sensor](https://youtu.be/q9KJ2nzXifs)

## Level 2 challenges

You are now ready to attempt the level 2 challenges. Each of these only requires one sensor unless otherwise specified.
Complete at least 2 of the level 2 challenges, but it is highly recommended you do at least one for each sensor. Demonstrate
them to the teacher for signature when ready.

* Challenge 2A: Press touch sensor to start moving, press same touch sensor again to stop moving
* Challenge 2B: Drive forward and change direction based on what the color sensor sees. Color blue causes a left turn,
color yellow causes a right turn, color red causes stop.
* Challenge 2C: If you have two colour sensors: Drive following a black line, turning as it turns. If you have one colour sensor, drive following a two coloured line.
* Challenge 2D: Drive forward until ultrasonic sensor detects an object in front, stop 5cm from the object, and sound an
alarm.
* Challenge 2E: Drive forward in a straight line until ultrasonic sensor detects an object in front, drive around the object
(the program can make assumptions about the object size rather than having to detect it all the way around), and then
continue driving in the original direction as if nothing was there.

## Level 3 challenges

To solve the challenges in level 3, you will have to do some of your own thinking and research. These are the harder challenges
and are designed to see which students are capable of the more demanding tasks. Some students will struggle to complete
these in time – remember it's ok to make mistakes – it's not ok to give up without trying!

Research, experiment, and attempt one of these challenges:

* Challenge 3A: Build a claw/gripper. Drive until ultrasonic or touch sensor detects an object in range, stop, and
grip/pickup the object.
* Challenge 3B: Build a forklift style lifting arm. Drive until ultrasonic or touch sensor detects an object in range, stop,
and lift the object.
* Challenge 3C: Build a drop arm that will fall around an object like a net. Drive until ultrasonic or touch sensor detects an
object in front. Drop the arm to catch the object, and drive off with it.

Note: You can custom make your own "object" from spare lego. You may want to adjust it's "shape" to suit the challenge you
are undertaking. For instance, an object that is thin on the base, but wider on top might help a forklift arm to slide underneath
it, but would probably not suit a claw.
